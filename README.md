# A2JSIMAGEMAP
Develop your own mini site that includes a main page and minimally two supplemental pages.  The main page should include an image that includes varying image-maps.  The theme of your site can be anything tasteful that you wish - it doesn't have to be a true map. The example includes three image-maps, however your site should support no less size maps.  Be creative.  The image-maps should map to the supplemental pages in accordance with the theme and objective.  Please make your supplemental pages more appealing than mine!

You will submit this assignment by providing the link to your GitHub repository that hosts the pages and image(s).

One image (minimum) on main page
